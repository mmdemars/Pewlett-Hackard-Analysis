- The largest group of retiring employees consist of Senior Engineers (25916) and Senior Staff (24926).
- 1549 of employees scheduled to retire would be eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
- 2 managers are retiring out of 5 managers currently employed, out of 9 departments.

## Summary
As the retirement dates approach for the employees eligible, the company faces a potential 24% workfoce reduction, totalling 72,458 retirement eleible employees. This is a very large portion of a seasoned and highly skilled workforce that may be difficult to replace while maintianing production quotas and quality standards. Of those retiring, 1549 employees would be qualified to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, which would give each mentor 47 individual employees to mentor - given the parttime status of the mentor position, there will not be enough employee mentors.

Suggested further queries include:
- looking up long tenured employees in manager-less departments to source possible replacements who will be familiar with the company and department in question
- looking up salaries of retiring employees to explore financial incentievs to retain some of these employees for longer in order to soften the blow of the silver tsunami.
